# The Future of CropImage.NET

CropImage.NET is a compatible rewrite of the [Asp.net Web Crop Image Control (WebCropImage)](http://webcropimage.codeplex.com/) by Cem Sisman. It will be maintained and supported to a much better standard than the original. 

CropImage.NET will stay focused on providing a solid cropping UI for ASP.NET WebForms, and being a good wrapper for JCrop & JCrop Preview (which are available separately through the [StudioJS project](http://studio.imageresizing.net/)).

Features such as built-in uploading, image resizing, rotation, filtering, adjustment, etc. don't belong in CropImage.NET. They will go in the upcoming ImageStudio2 project, which is a wrapper for the entire [StudioJS suite](http://studio.imageresizing.net/). 

If you don't want to wait around for the control (or if you prefer to manage your own javascript), take a look at the [StudioJS suite](http://studio.imageresizing.net/).

The programmatic image processing methods of WebCropImage have been replaced by [the ImageResizing.Net library](http://imageresizing.net/), which offers much superior capabilities and doesn't leak memory.
